Sure, here's a brief overview of each module/package you mentioned:

1. **Streamlit**: Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it 
easy to create web applications for machine learning and data science projects. It allows you to build interactive and customizable web 
interfaces using simple Python scripts. or GUI

2. **PyPDF2**: PyPDF2 is a Python library for working with PDF files. It allows you to read, 
write, and manipulate PDF documents. You can extract text, merge or split PDF files, add watermarks, and much more.

3. **LangChain**: I 
couldn't find specific information about a module named "LangChain." It's possible that it's a custom or internal module. If you provide 
more context or information about this module, I can try to provide an explanation.

4. **python-dotenv**: python-dotenv is a Python module that 
allows you to manage environment variables in your Python applications using a `.env` file. It simplifies the process of loading environment 
variables from a file into your Python script.

5. **faiss-cpu**:DATABASE TO STORE CHUNKS Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of large 
datasets. The "faiss-cpu" package provides CPU support for Faiss. It allows you to perform fast and scalable similarity search operations in 
high-dimensional vector spaces.

6. **OpenAI**: OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research laboratory that develops AI models and tools. The "openai" package likely 
provides access to OpenAI's APIs or libraries for using their AI models and services.

7. **huggingface_hub**: Hugging Face is a company that 
develops natural language processing (NLP) models and tools. The "huggingface_hub" package likely provides access to the Hugging Face Model Hub, where 
you can discover, share, and download pre-trained NLP models and related resources.

These modules/packages offer a wide range of functionalities for various 
tasks such as web application development, PDF manipulation, environment management, similarity search, AI model access, and NLP tasks. 



app.py have GUI

RUN app.py  = streamlit run app.py


When you run app.py after activating the virtual environment, it will automatically use the modules installed in that virtual environment. 
You don't need to modify app.py in any way for it to access these modules.


for offline embedding = pip install InstructorEmbedding sentence_transformers


create requirement.txt for your virtualenv 
env cmd = pip freeze > requirements.txt

install requirements txt file process = pip install -r requirements.txt
